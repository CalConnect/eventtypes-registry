= Event types registry (`eventtypes`)

== Introduction

This folder contains information about the "eventtypes" registry. This registry
defines values that can be used with the iCalendar `STRUCTURED-CATEGORY`
property.

The event types are defined in the `eventtypes.json` file (details below).

== Event type structure

The values are formed by taking the "prefix" and appending a "type" followed by
an optional "/" and a "subtype". So for example, a football match might have:

[source]
----
https://calconnect.org/ns/eventtypes/sports/football
----

Event type values can be mixed together to build different variations of events.

So for example, a football practice might have:

[source]
----
https://calconnect.org/ns/eventtypes/sports/football
https://calconnect.org/ns/eventtypes/activity/practice
----

== JSON schema

The JSON schema used in the `eventtypes.json` files is as follows:

[source]
----
; root object
OBJECT (prefix, types)

; namespace prefix
MEMBER prefix "prefix" : STRING

; Types
MEMBER types "types" : Object (
    *type
)

; An event type
MEMBER type "" : Object(
    ?description, ?links, ?types
)

; The description of a type
MEMBER description "description" : STRING

; Links to external resources associated with a type
MEMBER links "links" : ARRAY STRING
